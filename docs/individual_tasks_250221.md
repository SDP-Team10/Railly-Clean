### Daniel - 
How is the bin model coming along? Mate will be testing camera height today, the ML algorithm broke a bit when put into WeBots so it took time to fix that. Once he has it he can let you know how high we need it for edits. Take a look at the additional tests and alongside testing team figure out which aspects you have already tested and which need to be tested more. Next week: Would be useful to have a button presser appendage of some sort on the robot. Can discuss with whole team how we want to approach that on Monday or in chat this week if we have time.

### Arnav - 
Could you push your testing worlds to the repo if they aren't already there. Could you make sure the chairs edges are roughly in line with the tables too otherwise the robot will attempt to clean the air. Check out the test cases Anh and I created as we may need a few more environments to fit with the new test cases (e.g different pole diameters, different gaps between pole and chair, different lighting, etc.). Next week (this weekend if possible): button models (We need these to be pressable and have some way of alerting us when it has been pressed if possible). 

### Sean - 
Keep working on the associated movement and once that is finished let us know, then collab with testing team on the additional test cases to run hopefully tomorrow. Next week: Get the new bin robot to move close enough to the table so that rubbish will actually go into the bin. Assist vision/detection team with centering of the robot as this will require a lot of basic movement too.

### Austin - 
Video editing for the report (while you wait for us to provide content, it would be nice to collect some videos from testing team of our robot functioning, and if this could also have some music overlayed so that it isn't as boring in the video ;) ). Next week: Work with the new bin model to try and perfect rubbish removal using the arm. If there is extra time, try creating a new arm with 3 sections instead of two and see if this helps make it small enough to fit through the door. Once you have heights, I will try to edit the kinematics to fit this.

### Mate - 
Rubbish detection testing so you can let Daniel know the height needed. Then continue working with Apurv on making that work or adapting it to button detection 

### Apurv - 
1. Make any necessary changes to the rubbish detection if it doesn't work with webots images 2. If it works well and no changes needed, see if you can make a start on the button detection this week to save on time next week. Next week: Continue Button Detection, if finished let me know.

### Me, Suhas, Anh - 
Demo report, slides, video (Primarily slides and video now) We can start on the parts we are confident won't change.

### Anh - 
Next week: Integrating the centering into the main controller. Come up with functionality tests for the Table Clearing milestone.

### Suhas - 
Next week: Centering using image of sticker potentially if that is feasible. Create new function which figures out when the sticker is in the centre of the image for example. 

### Caitlin - 
Next week: On hand to assist with pretty much anything and everything ;) I'll probably be focusing on helping with centering/rubbish removal depending on how complex these issues turn out to be as well as modifying kinematics if Austin gets onto changing the arm.
